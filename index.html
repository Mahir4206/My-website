        <p>Hi someone,</p>
        It's been a long time we have been met. Hope you are well. I was reading my text book and all on a sudden I thought to give you a letter about my dream. Now I am writting about my dream to you.......
        I'm basically a studet of class 12. And I have many more dreams. I wanna go abroad to study in a European county.But there are 
        many difficies I have in my life. And money is one of those. To go abroad money is neccessery and must. Without money I can not do anything I want. If you have money or you are popular than you will get much value from others. Whatever, I also have a dream to be a programmar and I'm interested in working at Google-the largest tech giant. Google is my dream, my life, I'll definitely try to get a job at google. I hope My dream will come true. I'm keeping myself practicing and trying to be prepared. <br>
        thank you,

        <p>Yours ever,</p>
        Mahir
